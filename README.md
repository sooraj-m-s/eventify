```


### Start Celery Worker and Beat Scheduler

In separate terminals, run:

```shell
celery -A project worker -l info
celery -A project beat -l info
```




## Usage Guide

### User Registration and Login

1. Navigate to the registration page
2. Enter your details and submit the form
3. Verify your account using the OTP sent to your email
4. Log in with your credentials


### Messaging System

1. Access the messages page from the navigation menu
2. View your existing conversations
3. Click on a conversation to open the chat modal
4. Type your message and press Enter or click the Send button
5. For image sharing, click the image icon and select a file


### WebSocket Connection

The messaging system uses WebSockets for real-time communication:

- Connection status is displayed in the header
- Green indicator shows active connection
- Red indicator shows disconnected state (will auto-reconnect)


### Message Types

#### Notification WebSocket

- `new_message`: Received when a new message is sent to the user
- `user_status_update`: Received when a user's online status changes
- `message_read`: Received when messages are marked as read


#### Chat Room WebSocket

- `message`: Received when a new message is sent in the room
- `typing`: Received when a user starts or stops typing
- `participant_status`: Received when a participant's status changes


## WebSocket Architecture

The real-time messaging system uses a dual WebSocket architecture:

1. **Notification WebSocket**

1. Single connection per user
2. Handles system-wide notifications
3. Updates online status of users
4. Notifies about new messages across all conversations
5. Manages unread message counts


2. **Chat Room WebSocket**

1. One connection per active chat room
2. Handles message exchange within a specific room
3. Manages typing indicators
4. Provides message delivery confirmation
5. Updates read status of messages




This architecture ensures efficient real-time communication while minimizing connection overhead.

## Security Considerations

- All WebSocket connections require authentication
- Messages are validated on both client and server
- User permissions are checked for each action
- Rate limiting is implemented to prevent abuse
- Sensitive data is never transmitted over WebSockets
